# SQL_Browser

A simple SQL browser.

There are 4 options to use:

Note: in the below options I use `pip` and `python` instead of `pip3` and `python3` eventhough I wrote it in python3. My computer does not like 
it when I add the 3 so I did not include it in the examples. If these commands don't work for you, try adding a 3 to the first word.

1. Run with python. To do this run `pip install pymysql PyQt5` and then `python main.py`

2. Download prebuilt release (windows only). To do this go to releases and download the zip file with your os name. Unzip the file and run the main executable.

3. Build the executable yourself. To do this run `pip install pymysql PyQt5 cx_Freeze` and then `python main.py build`. After you do that, go the the 
build folder and run the executable.

4. Seek help from the allknowing wizard and rewrite the program yourself (by copying it if you are a real programmer) and then find a way to compilt it into a
diferent language like C. After you do that, cry because C is slower than python.
